# PlayNeurons v0.1
A tool for make sound from neuronal time series

A script to make your neuronal time series make sounds. You just have to add a time serie, or use the generator inside of it and listen to the sound of the neurons.
You can also edit the sound.

In my free time I will update it with metter features. If you want to collaborate join!
Enjoy!
